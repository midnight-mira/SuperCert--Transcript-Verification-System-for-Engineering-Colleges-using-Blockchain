# SERVER
Server uses MVC (not V) to handle requests coming from client and perform the following functions.

1. Authentication of admin using JWT
2. Capture the transactions made on blockchain
3. Sends email to the student (using nodemailer)

Note: Uploads folder will be created to store the document in the server before storing them to IPFS.
_____

- model consists of ipfs object and user, student and transaction document.
- routes consist of the routes for models
- controller handles the operations.
